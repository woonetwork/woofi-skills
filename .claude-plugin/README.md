# Plugin Manifest Notes

The `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` follows the Claude Code plugin validator requirements:

- `version` is mandatory
- Component fields (`skills`, `agents`, `commands`) must be arrays
- `skills` accepts directory paths when wrapped in arrays
- There is no `hooks` field — Claude Code auto-loads `hooks/hooks.json` by convention (not applicable to this project since we have no hooks)

This plugin only declares `skills` since the project contains no agents, commands, or hooks.
